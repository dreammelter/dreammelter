- 👋 Hi, I’m @dreammelter, a kid who grew up making art and tinkering with websites.
- 👀 I’m interested in building interactive experiences or tools that leverage both art and tech. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **React / Astro** (for web) and **Python** (for 3D) in my free time. Then **C#** for uni. <sub>:fire: This is fine. (0u0 ) :fire:</sub>
- 💞️ I’d like to collaborate on game or tech art projects (if you're open to new kids)
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter (or just about anywhere else on the web) at the same username. :+1:
