- 👋 Hi, I’m @dreammelter, a kid who grew up making art and tinkering with websites.
- 👀 I’m interested in building interactive experiences that leverage both art and tech. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Python** for use with **Django** <sub>(and eventually *Unreal Engine.*)</sub> 
Then the **General Web Trio** whenever I have to build sites. (Work uses *Dojo v1*, for example.) 
Lastly add **C++/C#** for uni. <sub>:fire: This is fine. (0u0 ) :fire:</sub>
- 💞️ I’m not sure what I'm able to collaborate on yet... :cry:
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter (or just about anywhere else on the web) at the same username. :+1:
