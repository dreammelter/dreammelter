- 👋 Hi, I’m @dreammelter, a kid who grew up making art and tinkering with websites.
- 👀 I’m interested in building interactive experiences that leverage both art and tech. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **React / Remix** (for web) and **Python** (for 3D) in my free time. Then **C++ / C#** for uni. <sub>:fire: This is fine. (0u0 ) :fire:</sub>
- 💞️ I’m not sure what I'm able to collaborate on yet... :cry:
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter (or just about anywhere else on the web) at the same username. :+1:
